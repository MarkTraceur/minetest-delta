An InfiniMiner/Minecraft inspired game.

NOTE: This file is somewhat outdated most of the time.

This is a development version:
- Don't expect it to work as well as a finished game will.
- Please report any bugs to me. That way I can fix them to the next release.
	- debug.txt is useful when the game crashes.

Public servers:
	kray.dy.fi :30000 (friend's server)
	celeron.55.lt :30000 (my own server)

Controls:
- See the in-game pause menu

Map directory:
- Map is stored in a directory, which can be removed to generate a new map.
- There is na command-line option for it: --map-dir
- As default, it is located in:
		../map
- Otherwise something like this:
	Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\minetest\map
	Linux: ~/.minetest/map
	OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/map

Configuration file:
- An optional configuration file can be used. See minetest.conf.example.
- Path to file can be passed as a parameter to the executable:
	--config <path-to-file>
- Defaults:
	- If built with -DRUN_IN_PLACE:
		../minetest.conf
		../../minetest.conf
	- Otherwise something like this:
		Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\minetest\minetest.conf
		Linux: ~/.minetest/minetest.conf
		OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/minetest.conf

Command-line options:
- Use --help

Compiling on GNU/Linux:

- You need:
	* CMake
	* Irrlicht
	* Zlib
- You can probably find these in your distro's package repository.
- Building has been tested to work flawlessly on many systems.

- Check possible options:
	$ cd whatever/minetest
	$ cmake . -LH

- A system-wide install:
	$ cd whatever/minetest
	$ cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
	$ make -j2
	$ sudo make install

	$ minetest

- Install to home directory:
	$ cd whatever/minetest
	$ cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/minetest_install
	$ make -j2
	$ make install

	$ ~/minetest_install/bin/minetest

- For running in the source directory:
	$ cd whatever/minetest
	$ cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE
	$ make -j2

	$ ./bin/minetest

Compiling on Windows:
- You need CMake, Irrlicht, Zlib and Visual Studio or MinGW
- NOTE: Probably it will not work easily and you will need to fix some stuff.
- Steps:
	- Start up the CMake GUI
	- Select your compiler
	- Hit "Configure"
	- Set up some options and paths
	- Hit "Configure"
	- Hit "Generate"
	- VC: Open the generated .sln and build it
	- MinGW: Browse to the build directory and run 'make'
